# Boulder – Game Tracking & Review Hub

**Boulder** is a full-stack web application where gamers can browse, track, and review video games.  
Built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, **MongoDB**, and **JWT authentication**, Boulder lets users manage personal game libraries, write reviews, and explore titles from a centralized database — all in a sleek, responsive interface.

This version of Boulder is a submission to Springboard Software Engineering Bootcamp, and will be updated prior to public launch after more version updates.
